# Maiku's Mod
A mod for BTA, the first Java code I've ever written and the first MC mod I've ever made.
More description later.



## Implemented features
- Sound dampener block
- Dynamic footstep sounds based on worn armor (WIP)
- Dynamic lighting (light emitting items emit light when held or dropped, modified https://github.com/FarnGitHub/BTA-Dynamic-Light-Mod)

## Planned features
- Gummy bears that give effects similar to modern MC's potions
- Atmospheric soundscapes
- Off-hand item slot to make building and spelunking easier
- Carpet (right click wool block to remove a layer at a time)
- Stone fences for thinner pillars
- Make the calendar and closk placeable

## Requirements
- BTA 1.7.7.0_02
- HalpLibe 2.7.0
